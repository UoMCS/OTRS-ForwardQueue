# TODO

 * Specify Perl module dependencies within the module code
 * Ensure that all required hash ref entries (options and query) are set
 * Create rollback mechanism to unlock ticket if anything fails (e.g. sending email)
 * Work out how to handle HTML emails - ideally want to strip these to the plain text body
